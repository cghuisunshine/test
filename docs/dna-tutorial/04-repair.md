## DNA damage and repair

DNA is chemically stable compared with RNA, but it still suffers damage from:
- Replication mistakes
- UV light
- Reactive oxygen species
- Chemicals (alkylating agents)
- Ionizing radiation (can cause double-strand breaks)

## Common damage types

### Base mismatches
Wrong base incorporated during replication (e.g., G paired with T).

### Base lesions
- **Deamination** (e.g., cytosine → uracil)
- **Oxidation** (e.g., 8-oxoG)

### Bulky lesions
- UV can create **thymine dimers** that distort the helix.

### Double-strand breaks (DSBs)
Both strands broken; particularly dangerous because information is lost.

## Major repair pathways (high level)

### Mismatch repair (MMR)
Fixes replication errors missed by proofreading.

### Base excision repair (BER)
Repairs small base lesions:
- A DNA glycosylase removes the damaged base.
- The backbone is cut, filled, and sealed.

### Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
Removes bulky distortions (like UV damage):
- Cut out a short single-stranded segment containing the lesion.
- Resynthesize and ligate.

### Double-strand break repair
Two major strategies:
- **Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)**: fast, can be error-prone.
- **Homologous recombination (HR)**: uses a homologous template (often sister chromatid), generally more accurate.

## Checkpoints and cancer connection
Cells monitor damage and can pause the cell cycle to repair.
- If repair fails or checkpoints fail, mutations accumulate.

> Many cancer therapies exploit repair weaknesses: if a tumor lacks one repair pathway, inhibiting a backup pathway can selectively harm cancer cells (synthetic lethality).
