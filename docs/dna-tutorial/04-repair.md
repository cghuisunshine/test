## DNA damage and repair

DNA is chemically stable compared with RNA, but it still suffers damage from:
- replication mistakes
- UV light
- reactive oxygen species
- chemicals (alkylating agents)
- ionizing radiation (can cause double-strand breaks)

Repair systems exist because even a low error rate becomes significant across a whole genome and many cell divisions.

## Common damage types

### Base mismatches
Wrong base incorporated during replication (e.g., G paired with T).

### Base lesions
- **Deamination** (e.g., cytosine → uracil)
- **Oxidation** (e.g., 8-oxoG)

### Bulky lesions
- UV can create **pyrimidine dimers** (often thymine dimers) that distort the helix.

### Double-strand breaks (DSBs)
Both strands broken; particularly dangerous because information is lost.

## Major repair pathways (high level)

### Mismatch repair (MMR)
Fixes replication errors missed by proofreading.
- Distinguishes the newly synthesized strand from the template.

**Example connection:** inherited MMR defects are associated with elevated cancer risk (e.g., Lynch syndrome).

### Base excision repair (BER)
Repairs small base lesions:
- A DNA glycosylase removes the damaged base.
- The backbone is cut, filled, and sealed.

### Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
Removes bulky distortions (like UV damage):
- Cut out a short single-stranded segment containing the lesion.
- Resynthesize and ligate.

**Example connection:** defects in NER can cause extreme UV sensitivity and skin-cancer risk (e.g., xeroderma pigmentosum).

### Direct reversal (in some organisms)
Some organisms use direct reversal mechanisms (for example, photolyase in many species repairs UV lesions using light energy). Humans rely largely on NER for UV photoproducts.

### Double-strand break repair
Two major strategies:
- **Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)**: fast, can be error-prone.
- **Homologous recombination (HR)**: uses a homologous template (often sister chromatid), generally more accurate.

## When repair can’t keep up: damage tolerance
If a replication fork encounters unrepaired damage, cells may use:
- **Fork stabilization and restart** mechanisms
- **Translesion synthesis** polymerases that can copy past lesions but can be more error-prone

This is a tradeoff: completing replication vs increased mutation risk.

## Checkpoints and cancer connection
Cells monitor damage and can pause the cell cycle to repair.
- If repair fails or checkpoints fail, mutations accumulate.

> Many cancer therapies exploit repair weaknesses: if a tumor lacks one repair pathway, inhibiting a backup pathway can selectively harm cancer cells (synthetic lethality).

## Mini-check
1. Which pathway would you expect to be important for UV lesions that distort DNA?
2. Why can NHEJ introduce mutations?
3. Why might translesion synthesis increase mutation rates?
