## Double helix structure

### Antiparallel strands
A DNA duplex is made of two strands running in opposite directions:
- One strand: **5′ → 3′**
- Complementary strand: **3′ → 5′**

This antiparallel geometry is essential for correct base pairing and for many enzymes that act on DNA.

### Major and minor grooves
The double helix has two unequal grooves:
- **Major groove**: wider; many proteins read base patterns here.
- **Minor groove**: narrower; still used by some proteins and small molecules.

Proteins can often recognize sequence **without fully unwinding** the helix because each base pair exposes a unique chemical pattern to the grooves.

### Common DNA conformations
- **B-DNA**: most common in cells.
- **A-DNA**: favored in dehydrated conditions and in some DNA/RNA hybrids.
- **Z-DNA**: left-handed helix; can form in specific sequences and conditions.

### Local structure is sequence-dependent
DNA is not a perfectly uniform rod. Certain sequences bend more easily or narrow/widen grooves, which can influence:
- nucleosome positioning
- transcription factor binding
- local replication/transcription dynamics

## DNA packaging in cells

### Prokaryotes vs eukaryotes
- **Bacteria/archaea**: compact DNA in a nucleoid; supercoiling is key; histone-like proteins exist (especially in archaea).
- **Eukaryotes**: DNA is packaged into **chromatin**, built around histones.

## Chromatin basics (eukaryotes)

### The nucleosome
A **nucleosome** is ~147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer:
- Histones: H2A, H2B, H3, H4 (two copies each)

```txt
DNA ---- wraps around ---- [histone core] ---- wraps around ---- DNA
```

Nucleosomes help compact DNA but also create a layer of regulation by controlling access.

### Histone tails and modifications
Histone proteins have flexible “tails” that can be chemically modified.
- Some modifications correlate with open chromatin (often associated with transcription).
- Others correlate with compact chromatin.

These marks can recruit proteins that change chromatin structure.

### Chromatin remodeling
**Chromatin remodelers** can slide, remove, or restructure nucleosomes.
- This changes accessibility of promoters/enhancers.
- Remodelers often use ATP.

### Euchromatin vs heterochromatin
- **Euchromatin**: more open, gene-rich, often actively transcribed.
- **Heterochromatin**: more compact, repetitive regions, often transcriptionally silent.

## Supercoiling and DNA topology

### Why supercoiling happens
When the helix is unwound during replication or transcription, the remaining DNA becomes **overwound** (torsional stress). If not relieved, this stress can stall enzymes.

### Topoisomerases (stress relief)
**Topoisomerases** cut and rejoin DNA to change its topology:
- Type I: cut one strand.
- Type II: cut both strands.

These enzymes are essential in replication and are targets of some antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs.

## Practical connection
Packaging and topology affect:
- Which genes are accessible.
- How fast replication/transcription can proceed.
- How damage is repaired (access to lesions).
