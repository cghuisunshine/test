## Mutation and variation

A **mutation** is a change in DNA sequence. Mutations create new alleles.

### Common mutation types
- **Substitution** (single-nucleotide variant, SNV)
- **Insertion/deletion** (indel)
- **Copy-number variant** (duplication/deletion of a region)
- **Structural variant** (inversions, translocations)

### Coding vs non-coding effects
- **Synonymous**: codon changes but amino acid stays the same.
- **Nonsynonymous**: amino acid changes.
- **Nonsense**: introduces a stop codon.
- Variants can also affect **regulatory elements** or **splicing**.

### Where mutations come from
- replication errors that escape proofreading + MMR
- damage from UV/oxidation and imperfect repair
- transposable elements (in some cases)

## Recombination and inheritance

### Meiosis and recombination
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes can exchange segments (crossing over).
- Generates new allele combinations.
- Helps proper chromosome segregation.

### Linkage and recombination “hotspots”
Nearby variants can be inherited together (linkage) unless recombination separates them.
- Recombination is not uniform; some regions recombine more frequently.

## Population perspective (very high level)

### Drift vs selection
- **Genetic drift**: random changes in allele frequencies, strongest in small populations.
- **Natural selection**: consistent differences in reproductive success.

### A classic example (conceptual)
The sickle-cell allele can be harmful in one context but beneficial in another.
- In malaria-endemic regions, heterozygotes may have an advantage (context-dependent selection).

## Variant interpretation (practical mindset)
- Many variants are neutral.
- Effects depend on context: gene, tissue, developmental stage, environment.
- Experimental validation and population data are both important.

> Caution: ancestry and population structure matter in genetics. A variant’s frequency (and even its interpretation) can differ across populations.

## Mini-check
1. Why can an indel cause a frameshift?
2. What’s the difference between genetic drift and selection?
3. Why does recombination complicate predicting inheritance patterns?
