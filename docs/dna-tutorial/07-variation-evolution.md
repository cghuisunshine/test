## Mutation and variation

A **mutation** is a change in DNA sequence. Mutations create new alleles.

### Common mutation types
- **Substitution** (single-nucleotide variant, SNV)
- **Insertion/deletion** (indel)
- **Copy-number variant** (duplication/deletion of a region)
- **Structural variant** (inversions, translocations)

### Coding vs non-coding effects
- **Synonymous**: codon changes but amino acid stays the same.
- **Nonsynonymous**: amino acid changes.
- **Nonsense**: introduces a stop codon.
- Variants can also affect **regulatory elements** or **splicing**.

## Recombination and inheritance

### Meiosis and recombination
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes can exchange segments (crossing over).
- Generates new allele combinations.
- Helps proper chromosome segregation.

### Population perspective (very high level)
- Evolution is change in allele frequencies over time.
- Selection acts on phenotypes produced by genotype + environment.

## Variant interpretation (practical mindset)
- Many variants are neutral.
- Effects depend on context: gene, tissue, developmental stage, environment.
- Experimental validation and population data are both important.
