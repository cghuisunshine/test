## DNA replication: copying the genome

### The big idea: semiconservative replication
Each new DNA duplex contains:
- One **parental** (old) strand
- One **newly synthesized** strand

### Origins of replication
Replication begins at **origins** where the duplex is opened and replication forks form.
- Bacteria often have a single origin on a circular chromosome.
- Eukaryotes have **many origins** on each linear chromosome.

## The replication fork (core components)

### Unwinding and stabilization
- **Helicase**: unwinds the double helix.
- **Single-strand binding proteins**: prevent strands from re-annealing.
- **Topoisomerases**: relieve torsional stress ahead of the fork.

### Priming and synthesis
DNA polymerases need a free **3′-OH**, so they use a primer.
- **Primase** makes a short RNA primer.
- **DNA polymerase** extends from that primer.

### Leading vs lagging strand
Because polymerases synthesize **5′ → 3′**:
- **Leading strand**: synthesized continuously *toward* the fork.
- **Lagging strand**: synthesized discontinuously as **Okazaki fragments** *away* from the fork.

Okazaki fragments are typically:
- ~1000–2000 nucleotides in many bacteria
- ~100–200 nucleotides in many eukaryotes

### Keeping polymerase attached (processivity)
Many replisomes use a **sliding clamp** (a ring-shaped protein) to keep polymerase from falling off DNA.
- A **clamp loader** uses ATP to open and place the clamp onto DNA.

### Finishing the job
- RNA primers are removed and replaced with DNA.
  - In bacteria, DNA polymerase I (and related activities) can help remove primers.
  - In eukaryotes, RNase H and FEN1 help remove RNA primers/flaps.
- **DNA ligase** seals remaining nicks.

## Fidelity: how replication stays accurate

### Proofreading
Many DNA polymerases have **3′ → 5′ exonuclease** activity to remove misincorporated bases.

### Post-replication correction
**Mismatch repair (MMR)** can fix errors that escape proofreading.

## Telomeres and the end-replication problem (eukaryotes)
Linear chromosomes have ends. After primer removal on the lagging strand, a gap can remain at the end.
- **Telomeres** are repetitive end sequences.
- **Telomerase** extends telomeres using an RNA template.

## Replication stress (why forks stall)
Forks can slow or stall due to:
- DNA damage
- hard-to-replicate regions (repeats, strong secondary structures)
- collisions with transcription machinery

Cells use checkpoints and repair pathways to stabilize stalled forks and prevent chromosome breaks.

## Mini-check
1. Why do polymerases need primers?
2. Why is the lagging strand discontinuous?
3. What is the purpose of a sliding clamp?

## Common misconceptions
- “Replication starts at the 3′ end.” → Origins define starts; synthesis always proceeds 5′ → 3′.
- “More hydrogen bonds alone explains everything.” → Base stacking and overall structure matter a lot.
