## Concept checks (multiple choice)

1. A DNA strand is written 5′ → 3′. The complementary strand (written 5′ → 3′) is the:
   - A) complement
   - B) reverse complement
   - C) reverse
   - D) codon

2. Which statement is most accurate about DNA stability?
   - A) Hydrogen bonds are the only stabilizing force.
   - B) Base stacking is a major contributor to stability.
   - C) AT pairs are stronger than GC pairs.
   - D) DNA has no directionality.

3. The lagging strand is discontinuous because:
   - A) polymerases can only synthesize 3′ → 5′
   - B) polymerases can only synthesize 5′ → 3′ and the strands are antiparallel
   - C) helicase blocks the leading strand
   - D) ligase can only work on RNA

4. UV light commonly causes:
   - A) double-strand breaks only
   - B) pyrimidine dimers that distort the helix
   - C) protein denaturation only
   - D) removal of telomeres

5. A mutation differs from an epigenetic change because:
   - A) mutations change sequence; epigenetic changes change gene activity without changing sequence
   - B) mutations are always harmful; epigenetic changes are always beneficial
   - C) epigenetics never persists through cell division
   - D) mutations happen only in RNA

### Answer key (multiple choice)
- 1: **B**
- 2: **B**
- 3: **B**
- 4: **B**
- 5: **A**

## Short answer (sample solutions)

### 1) Why is synthesis 5′ → 3′?
DNA polymerases add nucleotides by extending the **3′-OH** of the growing strand. The 3′-OH attacks the phosphate of the incoming nucleotide (which carries the energy for bond formation). This chemistry naturally supports 5′ → 3′ synthesis.

### 2) Compare NHEJ vs HR
- **NHEJ** directly rejoins DNA ends; it’s fast but can lose/add small numbers of bases.
- **HR** uses a homologous template (often a sister chromatid) to repair more accurately, but it’s not always available.

### 3) Give two ways cells regulate protein output
Examples:
- Change transcription rate (TFs, enhancers)
- Change splicing patterns
- Change mRNA stability (including miRNAs)
- Change translation initiation
- Change protein degradation (ubiquitin/proteasome)

### 4) Why can NGS reads be hard to align in repeats?
If a read sequence occurs in many similar locations, the aligner cannot confidently assign it to one unique position. This can reduce confidence in variant calls in repetitive regions.

## A short study plan (20–30 minutes)
1. Review the glossary, then explain each term in your own words.
2. Re-draw the replication fork from memory (label helicase, primase, polymerase, ligase).
3. Explain one repair pathway and what kind of damage it fixes.
4. Answer the multiple-choice set again without looking.
