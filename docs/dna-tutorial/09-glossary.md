## Glossary (quick reference)

### Molecules and structure
- **Base (nucleobase)**: A, T, G, C (DNA); U replaces T in RNA.
- **Nucleotide**: base + sugar + phosphate.
- **Phosphodiester bond**: linkage between nucleotides in the backbone.
- **Antiparallel**: two strands run in opposite 5′/3′ directions.
- **Major/minor groove**: surface features where proteins can “read” DNA.

### Replication and repair
- **Origin of replication**: site where replication begins.
- **Replication fork**: Y-shaped structure where DNA is unwound and copied.
- **Okazaki fragments**: short lagging-strand DNA fragments.
- **DNA ligase**: enzyme that seals nicks in the backbone.
- **MMR / BER / NER**: mismatch / base excision / nucleotide excision repair.
- **NHEJ / HR**: non-homologous end joining / homologous recombination.

### Gene expression
- **Promoter**: DNA region where transcription initiates.
- **Enhancer**: regulatory DNA that increases transcription in specific contexts.
- **Transcription factor (TF)**: protein that binds DNA and influences transcription.
- **mRNA / rRNA / tRNA**: messenger / ribosomal / transfer RNA.
- **Codon**: 3-nt mRNA unit encoding an amino acid or stop.
- **Reading frame**: how nucleotides are grouped into codons.

### Regulation and epigenetics
- **Chromatin**: DNA + associated proteins (mainly histones).
- **Nucleosome**: DNA wrapped around a histone core.
- **DNA methylation**: epigenetic mark often associated with reduced transcription.
- **Histone acetylation**: often correlates with open chromatin.
- **miRNA**: small RNA that can reduce protein output post-transcriptionally.

### Tools and data
- **PCR**: amplification of a target DNA region.
- **qPCR**: PCR with fluorescence-based quantification.
- **Sanger sequencing**: high-accuracy short-read sequencing.
- **NGS**: next-generation sequencing (massively parallel).
- **FASTA / FASTQ**: common sequence and sequence+quality file formats.
- **Coverage**: how many reads overlap a position.

> Tip: When you see an abbreviation, ask “molecule, process, or tool?” and “where in the DNA→RNA→protein flow does it act?”
