## Gene expression overview

Gene expression is how DNA sequence leads to functional products.
- **Transcription**: DNA → RNA
- **Translation**: RNA → protein

Many important RNAs are not translated (rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, etc.).

## Transcription: making RNA from DNA

### Promoters and transcription factors
A **promoter** is a DNA region where transcription begins.
- Transcription factors and RNA polymerase assemble into an initiation complex.

### RNA polymerase
RNA polymerase reads the DNA template and synthesizes RNA **5′ → 3′**.

### Eukaryotic mRNA processing (big picture)
After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNA is processed:
- **5′ cap**: protection and translation help
- **Splicing**: introns removed, exons joined
- **Poly(A) tail**: stability and export

Alternative splicing allows one gene to produce multiple isoforms.

## Translation: building proteins from mRNA

### The genetic code
- mRNA is read in **codons** (triplets).
- Codons specify amino acids or stop signals.

### tRNA and ribosomes
- **tRNA** carries amino acids and matches codons via anticodons.
- The **ribosome** catalyzes peptide-bond formation.

### Stages of translation
- **Initiation**: start codon sets the reading frame.
- **Elongation**: amino acids added in order.
- **Termination**: stop codon triggers release.

## Where regulation fits
Cells regulate expression at many points:
- Transcription rate
- Splicing choices
- mRNA stability
- Translation efficiency
- Protein modification/degradation
