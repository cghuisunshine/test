## Gene expression overview

Gene expression is how DNA sequence leads to functional products.
- **Transcription**: DNA → RNA
- **Translation**: RNA → protein

Many important RNAs are not translated (rRNA, tRNA, miRNA, etc.).

## Transcription: making RNA from DNA

### Promoters and transcription factors
A **promoter** is a DNA region where transcription begins.
- Proteins bind promoter DNA and help recruit RNA polymerase.
- In eukaryotes, transcription is often controlled by combinations of transcription factors at promoters + enhancers.

### RNA polymerase (core concept)
RNA polymerase reads the DNA template and synthesizes RNA **5′ → 3′**.

### Prokaryotes vs eukaryotes (big differences)
- **Prokaryotes**: transcription and translation can be coupled (happening at the same time).
- **Eukaryotes**: transcription occurs in the nucleus; translation occurs in the cytoplasm; RNA must be processed and exported.

### Eukaryotic mRNA processing (high level)
After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNA is processed:
- **5′ cap**: protection and translation initiation help
- **Splicing**: introns removed, exons joined
- **Poly(A) tail**: stability and export

Alternative splicing allows one gene to produce multiple isoforms.

## Translation: building proteins from mRNA

### The genetic code
- mRNA is read in **codons** (triplets).
- Codons specify amino acids or stop signals.
- The reading frame is set by the start site.

### tRNA and ribosomes
- **tRNA** carries amino acids and matches codons via anticodons.
- The **ribosome** (rRNA + proteins) catalyzes peptide-bond formation.

### Start and stop signals
- Start codon is commonly **AUG** (Met) in many systems.
- Stop codons: **UAA**, **UAG**, **UGA**.

mRNA: 5′ - AUG GAA UUU ... - 3′
AA :      Met Glu Phe ...
```

### Why frameshift mutations are disruptive
If you insert/delete bases not in multiples of 3 within a coding region, you shift the frame:
- downstream codons change
- stop codons can appear early

## After translation: proteins aren’t done yet
Proteins often require:
- folding (sometimes with chaperones)
- targeting (signals for secretion, nucleus, mitochondria, etc.)
- post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination)

## Where regulation fits
Cells regulate expression at many points:
- transcription rate
- splicing choices
- mRNA stability
- translation efficiency
- protein modification/degradation

## Mini-check
1. Why can transcription and translation be coupled in bacteria but not in eukaryotes?
2. What does splicing remove?
3. Why are stop codons essential?
