## Gene regulation: when and how much

Cells with the same DNA can behave differently because they turn different genes on/off.

### Layers of regulation
- **Transcriptional**: promoters, enhancers, transcription factors
- **Post-transcriptional**: splicing, RNA editing, mRNA stability
- **Translational**: initiation efficiency, ribosome recruitment
- **Post-translational**: protein modifications and degradation

## Enhancers and combinatorial control (eukaryotes)

### Enhancer logic
Enhancers can be far from a gene in linear DNA but close in 3D via looping.
- Multiple transcription factors often act together.
- Output depends on combinations (AND/OR-like logic), not single switches.

### Operons (prokaryotes)
Bacteria often group genes into **operons** that are transcribed together, coordinating pathways.

## Epigenetics: information beyond sequence

### Practical definition
Epigenetics refers to heritable cellular “memory” that changes gene activity **without changing the DNA sequence**.

### DNA methylation
- Often occurs at cytosines in CpG contexts (in mammals).
- Promoter methylation often correlates with reduced transcription.

### Histone modifications
Histone tails can be modified:
- **Acetylation** is often associated with open chromatin.
- **Methylation** can correlate with activation or repression depending on the site.

### Why epigenetics matters
- Cell differentiation: stable patterns of gene expression.
- Developmental processes and imprinting.
- Environmental effects can influence epigenetic state (complex and not always heritable across generations).

> Epigenetics is not “anything that happens to genes.” It specifically refers to regulation via chromatin state and related marks that can persist through cell division.
